## üí° **RATIONALE**

### **Why This Matters:**
1. **Inclusive by Design:** Users who post common actions still feel valued
2. **Removes Pressure:** No need to "perform uniqueness"
3. **Authentic Engagement:** People post what they actually did, not what's unique
4. **Collective Framing:** Emphasizes community over competition
5. **Data-First:** Focuses on tracking and patterns, not judgment
6. **Welcoming Tone:** New users aren't intimidated
7. **Sustainable:** Long-term users won't burn out trying to be unique

### **What We Keep:**
- ‚úÖ Percentile data (it's useful information)
- ‚úÖ Tier badges (neutral descriptors like "rare", "common")
- ‚úÖ Leaderboards (competition is optional)
- ‚úÖ Comparison scopes (city vs. world is interesting)

### **What We Change:**
- ‚ùå Language implying "unique = good, common = bad"
- ‚ùå Pressure to be different
- ‚ùå Exclusionary messaging
- ‚ùå Comparison language ("more unique than")

- Less preachy (we don't tell you how to be)
- More scientific (observation, not prescription)
- More inclusive (everyone has a place)
- More sustainable (no performance pressure)
