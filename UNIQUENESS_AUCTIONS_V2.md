## 🌟 **Core Concept**

### **The Big Idea**
**"Put your confidence where your uniqueness is."**

When you post an action, you don't just share it - you **BET** on how unique you think it is. The more confident you are, the more you stake. If you're right, you win big. If you're wrong, you lose it all.

### **Why This Changes Everything**

**Current State (V1):**
```
User posts action → Gets tier score → "Cool, I'm top 8%" → Scrolls away
Engagement: Passive, one-time reaction
```

**With Auctions (V2):**
```
User posts action → Stakes SPARKs on prediction → Waits anxiously → Result reveals → 
"YES! 500 SPARKS!" or "NOOO! Lost 50!" → Checks leaderboard → Plans next bet
Engagement: Active, emotional, strategic, repeatable
```

### **Key Differentiators**
- ✅ **Skill-based**: Not luck, requires understanding your community
- ✅ **High stakes**: Real emotional investment through loss aversion
- ✅ **Social status**: SPARK count shows expertise, not just uniqueness
- ✅ **Meta-game**: Adds strategy layer on top of creativity
- ✅ **Viral moments**: "I just won 1,000 SPARKs!" is shareable content

---

## 💎 **The Currency: SPARK Tokens**

### **What are SPARKs?**
- Virtual currency representing "originality energy"
- Cannot be purchased with real money (keeps economy pure)
- Earned only through accurate uniqueness predictions
- Required for premium features and status symbols

### **Why SPARKs Matter**

**Utility Value:**
- Unlock custom cosmic themes (200 SPARKs)
- Early access to trending content (100 SPARKs/day)
- Boost post visibility (50 SPARKs)
- Remove ads if implemented (500 SPARKs/month)
- "Oracle Vision" live stats (100 SPARKs/day)

**Social Value:**
- Leaderboard rankings
- "Oracle" badge for top predictors
- Conversation starter: "How do you have 5,000 SPARKs?!"
- Proves you understand what makes things unique

**Psychological Value:**
- Visible measure of expertise
- Flex on friends
- Investment in the platform
- Status symbol in community

### **Starter Balance**
- New users: 100 SPARKs
- Referrals: 50 bonus SPARKs
- Daily login: +5 SPARKs
- First post: +10 SPARKs

---

## 🎲 **How Betting Works**

### **Step 1: Create Your Post**
```
User writes: "Spent 3 hours building a birdhouse from recycled skateboards"
```

### **Step 2: Choose Your Confidence Tier**

#### **🔥 BOLD BET (50 SPARKs)**
```
Claim: "Nobody else did this. I'm Elite tier."
Risk: 50 SPARKs
Reward: 500 SPARKs (10x)
Target: Elite tier only
```

#### **⚡ CONFIDENT (20 SPARKs)**
```
Claim: "This is pretty unique. Rare/Elite tier."
Risk: 20 SPARKs
Reward: 100 SPARKs (5x)
Target: Rare or Elite tier
```

#### **💫 MODERATE (10 SPARKs)**
```
Claim: "Probably uncommon. Notable+ tier."
Risk: 10 SPARKs
Reward: 30 SPARKs (3x)
Target: Notable, Rare, or Elite tier
```

#### **✨ SAFE (5 SPARKs)**
```
Claim: "Just posting, no big claim."
Risk: 5 SPARKs
Reward: 10 SPARKs (2x)
Target: Any tier except Common
```

#### **🌙 NO BET (0 SPARKs)**
```
Claim: "Just vibing, not betting."
Risk: 0 SPARKs
Reward: 0 SPARKs
No financial engagement
```

### **Step 3: Wait for Results**
```
Processing...
Vector embedding calculation...
Scope-aware duplicate detection...
Percentile calculation...

Result: "RARE TIER - Top 15%"

You bet: CONFIDENT (predicted Rare/Elite) ✅
Outcome: WIN!
Reward: +100 SPARKs

New Balance: 120 → 220 SPARKs 📈
Win Rate: 65% → 67%
```

## 🎯 **Risk vs. Reward Matrix**

### **BOLD BET (50 SPARKs) - "I'm Elite"**
| Actual Result | Outcome | SPARKs | Note |
|---------------|---------|--------|------|
| **Elite** | Perfect! | **+500** 🔥 | Nailed it - 10x return |
| **Rare** | Close! | **+250** ⚡ | Half reward - still impressive |
| **Notable** | Meh | **-25** 😬 | Half refund - you tried |
| **Popular** | Oof | **-50** 💀 | Full loss |
| **Common** | RIP | **-50** 💀 | Full loss |

### **CONFIDENT BET (20 SPARKs) - "I'm Rare/Elite"**
| Actual Result | Outcome | SPARKs | Note |
|---------------|---------|--------|------|
| **Elite** | Perfect! | **+100** ✅ | Maximum win |
| **Rare** | Perfect! | **+100** ✅ | Maximum win |
| **Notable** | Okay | **+30** 😊 | Partial win - within range |
| **Popular** | Nope | **-20** 😬 | Full loss |
| **Common** | Nope | **-20** 😬 | Full loss |

### **MODERATE BET (10 SPARKs) - "I'm Notable+"**
| Actual Result | Outcome | SPARKs | Note |
|---------------|---------|--------|------|
| **Elite** | Great! | **+30** ✅ | Win - within range |
| **Rare** | Great! | **+30** ✅ | Win - within range |
| **Notable** | Good | **+30** ✅ | Win - within range |
| **Popular** | Barely | **+5** 😐 | Tiny consolation prize |
| **Common** | Loss | **-10** 😬 | Full loss |

### **SAFE BET (5 SPARKs) - "I'm not Common"**
| Actual Result | Outcome | SPARKs | Note |
|---------------|---------|--------|------|
| **Elite** | Win | **+10** 😌 | Small win |
| **Rare** | Win | **+10** 😌 | Small win |
| **Notable** | Win | **+10** 😌 | Small win |
| **Popular** | Win | **+10** 😌 | Small win |
| **Common** | Loss | **-5** 😬 | Small loss |

### **Expected Value Calculations**

Assuming skill-based predictions with 60% accuracy:

```
BOLD BET:
60% chance: +500 SPARKs
40% chance: -50 SPARKs
EV = (0.6 × 500) + (0.4 × -50) = 300 - 20 = +280 SPARKs
ROI = 560% (high risk, high reward)

CONFIDENT:
60% chance: +100 SPARKs
40% chance: -20 SPARKs
EV = (0.6 × 100) + (0.4 × -20) = 60 - 8 = +52 SPARKs
ROI = 260% (balanced)

MODERATE:
60% chance: +30 SPARKs
40% chance: -10 SPARKs
EV = (0.6 × 30) + (0.4 × -10) = 18 - 4 = +14 SPARKs
ROI = 140% (safe)

SAFE:
80% chance: +10 SPARKs
20% chance: -5 SPARKs
EV = (0.8 × 10) + (0.2 × -5) = 8 - 1 = +7 SPARKs
ROI = 140% (very safe)
```

**Key Insight:** Skilled players earn more with aggressive betting. Beginners should start safe.

## 🧠 **Strategic Depth & Anti-Gaming**

### **Challenge 1: The "Nonsense Gaming" Problem**
**What if everyone posts ultra-obscure garbage to win BOLD bets?**

Example:
```
"Ate 47 purple harmonicas while juggling tax documents"
Result: Elite tier (nobody else did it)
Problem: Meaningless content, breaks platform integrity
```

#### **Solution A: AI Coherence Validation**
```typescript
interface CoherenceCheck {
  isRealAction: boolean        // Can this physically happen?
  isSpecificEnough: boolean    // Too vague? "did stuff" ❌
  isTooObscure: boolean        // Nonsensical? "ate harmonicas" ❌
  hasIntent: boolean           // Is there purpose/meaning?
  sentiment: 'authentic' | 'gaming' | 'unclear'
}

// Examples:
✅ "Built a treehouse in my backyard" 
   → Real, specific, meaningful

✅ "Made kombucha using only foraged ingredients"
   → Real, specific, intentional

⚠️ "Did something really unique today"
   → Too vague, rejected

❌ "Ate 47 purple harmonicas"
   → Nonsensical, auto-rejected

❌ "asdfghjkl qwerty unique thing"
   → Gaming detected, banned
```

**Implementation:**
- Use existing embedding model for semantic validation
- Check against dictionary of real actions (hiking, cooking, reading, etc.)
- Flag outliers for manual review
- 3 rejected posts = temp ban from BOLD bets

#### **Solution B: Engagement Multiplier**
```
Base Reward × Engagement Factor = Final SPARKs

Elite + 50 reactions = 500 SPARKs × 2.0 = 1,000 SPARKs
Elite + 10 reactions = 500 SPARKs × 1.2 = 600 SPARKs
Elite + 2 reactions = 500 SPARKs × 0.8 = 400 SPARKs
Elite + 0 reactions = 500 SPARKs × 0.5 = 250 SPARKs
```

**Why it works:**
- Rewards meaningful uniqueness that resonates
- Punishes obscure nonsense nobody cares about
- Creates incentive for quality, not just rarity
- Natural community moderation

#### **Solution C: "Aspirational Unique" Bonus**
```
If 5+ people try your unique action within 7 days:
→ +100 SPARK "Trendsetter Bonus"
→ "You inspired the community!"

If 20+ people try it:
→ +500 SPARK "Movement Starter"
→ Special badge
```

**Why it works:**
- Rewards positive influence
- Encourages shareable, inspiring uniqueness
- Balances obscurity vs. accessibility
- Creates heroes in the community

---

### **Challenge 2: The "Always Safe" Problem**
**What if everyone just bets SAFE to never lose?**

#### **Solution A: Daily SPARK Decay**
```
Every day at midnight:
- Lose 1% of SPARKs if you didn't post
- Lose 0.5% if you only bet SAFE/MODERATE
- No decay if you placed at least 1 CONFIDENT/BOLD bet

Example:
Balance: 1,000 SPARKs
No activity: -10 SPARKs/day = 700 SPARKs in 30 days
Only SAFE bets: -5 SPARKs/day = 850 SPARKs in 30 days
Active player: 0 decay + earnings = 1,500+ SPARKs
```

**Why it works:**
- Forces circulation, prevents hoarding
- Rewards active, aggressive play
- Creates urgency: "Use it or lose it"
- Balanced by earning opportunities

#### **Solution B: BOLD Streak Multipliers**
```
Place 3 BOLD bets this week → Next BOLD bet = 1.5x reward
Place 5 BOLD bets this week → Next BOLD bet = 2x reward
Place 10 BOLD bets this month → "High Roller" badge

Example:
Normal BOLD win: +500 SPARKs
With 5-bet streak: +1,000 SPARKs
```

**Why it works:**
- Rewards consistent aggressive play
- Creates gambling-like excitement
- Encourages "one more bet" mentality
- Differentiates experts from casuals

#### **Solution C: Leaderboard Tiers**
```
Monthly Rankings:

Top 1%: "Oracle" badge + 1,000 bonus SPARKs
Top 5%: "Sage" badge + 500 bonus SPARKs
Top 10%: "Visionary" badge + 200 bonus SPARKs
Top 25%: "Predictor" badge + 50 bonus SPARKs

Shown on profile, shareable on social media
```

**Why it works:**
- Social status motivates competition
- Can't win by playing safe (low earnings)
- Monthly reset keeps it fresh
- Everyone has a chance each month

---

### **Challenge 3: The "Beginner Frustration" Problem**
**New users don't know how to predict uniqueness yet.**

#### **Solution A: Learning Curve Protection**
```
First 10 bets: 50% loss protection

Example:
Bet: BOLD (50 SPARKs)
Result: Common (full loss normally)
With protection: Only lose 25 SPARKs
Refund message: "Learning bonus: +25 SPARKs back"
```

#### **Solution B: Prediction Hints**
```
Before betting, show contextual data:

"In Phoenix, 'hiking' is usually Notable tier (Top 30%)"
"On weekends, food posts are 40% more common"
"Your action contains 'coffee' - Popular tier 60% of the time"
"Similar to your post: 3 people today (Rare tier likely)"
```

**Why it works:**
- Educational, not hand-holding
- Users learn patterns naturally
- Builds confidence gradually
- Data-driven, not opinionated

#### **Solution C: Practice Mode**
```
Toggle: "Virtual Bet" mode

- See what you WOULD have won/lost
- No actual SPARK impact
- Tracked separately: "Practice Win Rate: 45%"
- Suggestion: "Your practice rate is 60%+, try real bets!"
```

## 🏆 **Advanced Features**

### **1. "Double Down" Mechanic** 🎲

**Scenario:**
```
You post: "Made sushi from scratch"
Bet: BOLD (50 SPARKs)

[10 minutes later]
Notification: "⚠️ 3 people just posted similar actions"

Options:
1. 🏃 RETREAT
   - Get 25 SPARKs back (50% refund)
   - Post is cancelled
   - Safe exit

2. 💪 DOUBLE DOWN
   - Stake +50 more SPARKs (100 total)
   - If Elite: +1,000 SPARKs (10x)
   - If not Elite: -100 SPARKs
   - "I'm STILL more unique!"

3. 🔥 YOLO MODE
   - Stake ALL remaining SPARKs (max 500)
   - If Elite: +5,000 SPARKs (10x)
   - If not Elite: Lose everything
   - Legendary moment either way
```

**Why it's exciting:**
- Real-time drama as situation changes
- Can turn bad bet into legendary win
- Social sharing: "I just YOLO'd 500 SPARKs!"
- Creates memorable moments

**UI Flow:**
```
[Push notification]
"🚨 Your BOLD bet is at risk!"

[Open app]
[Dramatic countdown timer: 5:00 minutes to decide]
[Graph showing: 3 similar posts in last hour]
[Risk meter: "Elite chance: 40% → 20%"]

[Three big buttons with animations]
🏃 Retreat (Safe)  💪 Double Down (Risky)  🔥 YOLO (Insane)
```

---

### **2. "Syndicate Bets"** 👥

**Concept:** Team betting with friends

**How it works:**
```
1. Create Syndicate (2-5 friends)
2. Each member stakes equal SPARKs (e.g., 20 each = 100 pool)
3. Set group goal: "3/5 of us will hit Rare+ today"
4. Each posts their unique action
5. If goal met: Everyone gets 2x their stake
6. If goal missed: Everyone loses their stake

Example:
Sarah, Jake, Emma, Mike, Lisa each stake 20 SPARKs (100 total)
Goal: 3/5 hit Rare tier

Results:
- Sarah: Elite ✅
- Jake: Rare ✅
- Emma: Notable ❌
- Mike: Rare ✅
- Lisa: Popular ❌

3/5 succeeded! ✅
Everyone gets: 20 × 2 = 40 SPARKs back (+20 profit each)
```

**Advanced Syndicate Features:**
- **Themed Syndicates:** "Food Week" - all food-related posts
- **Progressive Pools:** Failed bet rolls into next day
- **Syndicate Leaderboards:** Best group of the month
- **Cross-Syndicate Challenges:** Group A vs. Group B

**Why it works:**
- Social bonding through shared risk
- Peer pressure to be creative
- Group chat explodes with updates
- Viral sharing: "My squad just won 200 SPARKs!"

---

### **3. "Hedge Your Bet"** 📊

**Concept:** Diversify risk across multiple posts

**Example:**
```
User's strategy for the day:

Post A: "Made coffee" 
Bet: SAFE (5 SPARKs)
Expected: Popular tier, +10 SPARKs guaranteed

Post B: "Made kombucha from foraged ingredients"
Bet: CONFIDENT (20 SPARKs)
Expected: Rare tier, +100 SPARKs

Post C: "Built fermentation chamber with Arduino sensors"
Bet: BOLD (50 SPARKs)
Expected: Elite tier, +500 SPARKs

Total Risk: 75 SPARKs
Best Case: +610 SPARKs
Worst Case: -65 SPARKs
Average Case: +150 SPARKs (one hits Rare)
```

**Rules:**
- Max 3 posts per day with bets
- Posts must be distinct actions (no gaming)
- Coherence check on all posts

**Why it works:**
- Portfolio strategy for risk-averse users
- More engagement (multiple posts)
- Teaches probability and risk management
- Creates interesting decision-making

---

### **4. "Oracle Challenges"** 🔮

**Concept:** Predict OTHER people's uniqueness

**How it works:**
```
1. Scroll feed, see posts marked "⏳ Pending Results"
2. User claimed: "BOLD bet - I'm Elite tier"
3. You predict: "Nah, they're only Notable" (stake 10 SPARKs)
4. When results reveal:
   - You're right: +20 SPARKs
   - You're wrong: -10 SPARKs
```

**Advanced Oracle Features:**

**A. Oracle Leaderboard**
```
Top Oracle Predictors:
1. @sarah_knows - 89% accuracy, 5,420 SPARKs earned
2. @prediction_king - 84% accuracy, 3,210 SPARKs earned
3. @phoenix_oracle - 81% accuracy, 2,890 SPARKs earned
```

**B. Prediction Streaks**
```
Correct predictions in a row:
5 streak: 1.5x multiplier
10 streak: 2x multiplier
20 streak: "Perfect Oracle" badge
```

**C. Specialist Badges**
```
"Food Oracle" - 80%+ accuracy on food posts
"Fitness Guru" - 80%+ accuracy on workout posts
"Phoenix Expert" - 80%+ accuracy on Phoenix posts
```

**Why it works:**
- New engagement layer (passive consumption → active prediction)
- Learn what makes things unique
- Community builds expertise
- Gamification of feed browsing

---

### **5. "SPARK Insurance"** 🛡️

**Concept:** Pay premium to reduce risk

**How it works:**
```
Base Bet: BOLD (50 SPARKs)
Insurance: 10 SPARKs

Total Cost: 60 SPARKs upfront

Outcomes:
If Elite: +500 SPARKs (insurance refunded)
If not Elite: Only lose 35 SPARKs instead of 50

Net Risk: 35 vs. 50 (30% reduction)
Cost: 10 SPARKs (20% of bet)
```

**Insurance Tiers:**
```
BASIC INSURANCE (10 SPARKs)
- Lose 30% less on failed bets
- Single bet coverage

PREMIUM INSURANCE (50 SPARKs/day)
- Lose 50% less on ALL failed bets today
- Unlimited coverage

SYNDICATE INSURANCE (100 SPARKs)
- Protect entire group bet
- Shared cost among members
```

**Why it works:**
- Risk management for high-stakes players
- Another SPARK sink (economy balancing)
- Teaches financial concepts
- Appeals to different player types

---

---

## 📊 **Psychology & Engagement**

### **1. Loss Aversion (Kahneman & Tversky)** 😰

**Principle:** People feel losses 2x more strongly than equivalent gains

**Application:**
```
Losing 50 SPARKs feels worse than winning 50 feels good
→ User thinks: "I CAN'T lose my 200 SPARKs!"
→ High emotional investment
→ Checks app frequently
→ Shares wins (recovery from loss feels amazing)
```

**Design Implications:**
- Make losses visible but not punitive
- Celebrate recovery from losses
- "You're back in the green!" notifications
- Loss animations are shorter than win animations

---

### **2. Skill Expression (Self-Determination Theory)** 🎯

**Principle:** People engage more when they feel competent and improving

**Application:**
```
Week 1: 40% win rate → "Keep learning!"
Week 4: 65% win rate → "You're getting good at this!"
Week 12: 75% win rate → "You're an Oracle!"

Progress = Competence = Engagement
```

**Design Implications:**
- Track and display improvement over time
- "Your prediction accuracy improved 15% this month!"
- Unlock "skill tiers" as you improve
- Show learning resources (hints, stats)

---

### **3. Variable Reward Schedules (Skinner)** 🎰

**Principle:** Unpredictable rewards are most addictive

**Application:**
```
Sometimes win big (500 SPARKs)
Sometimes barely win (10 SPARKs)
Sometimes lose (but protected by insurance)
Never know exact outcome

= Dopamine hits at random intervals
= "Just one more bet" mentality
```

**Design Implications:**
- Add surprise bonuses randomly
- "Lucky! 2x SPARKs today!"
- Mystery reward notifications
- Jackpot moments (rare 10x wins)

---

### **4. Status Signaling (Social Psychology)** 👑

**Principle:** People want to display their achievements

**Application:**
```
High SPARK count = Visible status
"Oracle" badge = Social proof
Leaderboard rank = Bragging rights
Win streaks = Conversation starter

Profile becomes flex page
```

**Design Implications:**
- Make achievements highly visible
- Shareable stat cards
- "Flex your SPARKs" social features
- Exclusive themes for high earners

---

### **5. Sunk Cost Fallacy (Behavioral Economics)** 🎢

**Principle:** Past investment drives future commitment

**Application:**
```
User has 500 SPARKs invested
Loses 200 on a bad bet
Thinks: "I've come this far, can't quit now"
Places another bet to recover losses
= Continued engagement
```

**Design Implications:**
- Show "total SPARKs earned all-time"
- Display journey progress
- "You're 200 SPARKs away from Oracle status"
- Make milestones visible

---

### **6. Social Proof (Cialdini)** 📱

**Principle:** People copy what others are doing

**Application:**
```
"47 people are betting right now"
"Sarah just won 1,000 SPARKs!"
"High Roller Hour: 200+ active bettors"

= FOMO effect
= "Everyone's playing, I should too"
```

**Design Implications:**
- Live activity feeds
- Friend activity notifications
- "X friends are online now"
- Trending bets section

---

### **7. Commitment & Consistency (Cognitive Dissonance)** 📝

**Principle:** People want to be consistent with past actions

**Application:**
```
User places BOLD bet
Public declaration: "I think I'm Elite!"
Now committed to that belief
Will check results compulsively
Will defend choice to friends

= Higher engagement
= More sharing
```

**Design Implications:**
- Make bets semi-public (friends can see)
- Allow pre-bet trash talk
- Highlight prediction streaks
- Celebrate consistency ("10 BOLD bets in a row!")

---

## 💰 **SPARK Economy Balancing**

### **Faucets (SPARKs Enter System)**

```typescript
// Daily Sources
dailyLogin:           +5 SPARKs

weeklyChampion:       +1,000 SPARKs
monthlyTop10:         +200-1,000 SPARKs
```

### **Sinks (SPARKs Leave System)**

```typescript
// Losing Bets (Primary Sink)

moderateBetLoss:      -10 SPARKs
confidentBetLoss:     -20 SPARKs

postBoost:            -50 SPARKs/post
removeAds:            -500 SPARKs/month
premiumBadge:         -1,000 SPARKs

// Insurance
basicInsurance:       -10 SPARKs/bet
premiumInsurance:     -50 SPARKs/day
syndicateInsurance:   -100 SPARKs/group

// Decay (Critical Sink)
dailyDecay:           -1% (if no activity)
```

### **Projected Economy at Scale**

```
Assumptions:
- 10,000 active users
- Average 2 bets/user/day
- 60% win rate (skilled players)
- 30% take premium features

Daily Flow:
Faucets:  ~300,000 SPARKs enter
Sinks:    ~280,000 SPARKs leave
Net:      +20,000 SPARKs/day (+7% inflation)

With decay enabled:
Decay:    -1% of total supply/day
Net:      ~Balanced inflation

Long-term equilibrium: 
Most users: 50-500 SPARKs
Active players: 500-2,000 SPARKs
Experts: 2,000-10,000 SPARKs
Legends: 10,000+ SPARKs
```

### **Anti-Inflation Measures**

**1. Dynamic Decay Rate**
```
If total supply > target:
  Increase decay to 1.5%/day

If total supply < target:
  Decrease decay to 0.5%/day
```

**2. Seasonal Resets**
```
Monthly: Balance → Legacy Points
Everyone starts fresh at 100 SPARKs
Removes hoarded SPARKs from circulation
```

**3. Premium Sinks**
```
Introduce new features that cost SPARKs:
- Custom animations: 500 SPARKs
- Name colors: 300 SPARKs
- Profile frames: 400 SPARKs
- Exclusive emojis: 200 SPARKs
```

**4. Charity Donations**
```
Donate SPARKs to:
- New user welcome pools
- Community events
- Feature development fund

Get "Philanthropist" badge
Tax write-off for ego 😄
```

## 📊 **Technical Architecture**

### **Backend Services**

```typescript
// Core SPARK service
class SparkService {
  async placeBet(userId: string, postId: string, betType: BetType): Promise<Bet>
  async resolveBet(betId: string, actualTier: Tier): Promise<BetResult>
  async getUserBalance(userId: string): Promise<SparkBalance>
  async processDecay(): Promise<void> // Daily cron
  async calculateLeaderboard(): Promise<Leaderboard> // Hourly cron
}

// Event management
class EventService {
  async getCurrentEvents(): Promise<Event[]>
  async applyEventMultipliers(baseReward: number): Promise<number>
  async scheduleEvent(event: Event): Promise<void>
}

// Anti-gaming
class CoherenceService {
  async validateAction(action: string): Promise<CoherenceCheck>
  async calculateEngagementMultiplier(postId: string): Promise<number>
  async detectAspirationBonus(actionId: string): Promise<boolean>
}

// Social features
class SyndicateService {
  async createSyndicate(members: string[], goal: string): Promise<Syndicate>
  async resolveSyndicate(syndicateId: string): Promise<void>
  async inviteToSyndicate(syndicateId: string, userId: string): Promise<void>
}
```

### **Database Optimization**

```sql
-- Fast balance lookups
CREATE INDEX idx_user_sparks_balance ON user_sparks(balance DESC);

-- Leaderboard queries
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW leaderboard_cache AS
  SELECT user_id, balance, win_rate, total_earned
  FROM user_sparks
  ORDER BY balance DESC
  LIMIT 1000;

REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY leaderboard_cache;

-- Bet history pagination
CREATE INDEX idx_bets_user_created ON bets(user_id, created_at DESC);

-- Event filtering
CREATE INDEX idx_events_active_time ON events(active, start_time, end_time);
```

### **Caching Strategy**

```typescript
// Redis caching for hot data
const cache = {
  userBalance: 'sparks:balance:{userId}',      // TTL: 5 min
  leaderboard: 'sparks:leaderboard:top1000',  // TTL: 1 hour
  eventMultipliers: 'sparks:events:active',   // TTL: 5 min
  userStats: 'sparks:stats:{userId}',         // TTL: 1 hour
}

// Invalidation triggers
- Balance change → Invalidate user balance & leaderboard
- Event start/end → Invalidate event multipliers
- Bet result → Invalidate user stats
```

### **Real-Time Updates**

```typescript
// WebSocket events for live updates
enum SparkEvent {
  BALANCE_CHANGED = 'sparks:balance',
  BET_RESOLVED = 'sparks:bet:resolved',
  LEADERBOARD_UPDATED = 'sparks:leaderboard',
  EVENT_STARTED = 'sparks:event:start',
  DOUBLE_DOWN_ALERT = 'sparks:doubledown:alert'
}

// Client subscription
socket.on('sparks:balance', (data) => {
  updateBalanceUI(data.newBalance)
  showChangeAnimation(data.change)
})
```

### **Scalability Considerations**

**Current Scale (Phase 1-3):**
- 10K users: Single PostgreSQL instance
- 100K bets/day: Redis for caching
- 1K concurrent: Standard Node.js servers

**Future Scale (Phase 4-6):**
- 100K users: Read replicas for PostgreSQL
- 1M bets/day: Sharded Redis clusters
- 10K concurrent: Load-balanced microservices
- Real-time: Dedicated WebSocket servers

## 🎬 **Closing Thoughts**

**Uniqueness Auctions transforms OnlyOne.Today from:**

❌ "Cool, I'm unique" → *scrolls away*

✅ "I NEED to check if I won my bet!" → *opens app 10x/day*

**It's not just a feature. It's THE feature that makes everything else addictive.**

Every post becomes a calculated risk.
Every result becomes an emotional moment.
Every week becomes a competition.

**This is how we win.**
